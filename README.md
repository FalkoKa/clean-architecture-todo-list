This is a very simple react todo list app, built for the purpose of practicing the Clean Architecture design pattern from uncle bob.

> By separating the software into layers, and conforming to The Dependency Rule, you will create a system that is intrinsically testable, with all the benefits that implies. When any of the external parts of the system become obsolete, like the database, or the web framework, you can replace those obsolete elements with a minimum of fuss.

This app is consistently built using through dependency inversion till its most outer layer, a fundamental principle of SOLID design pattern and thus, clean architecture.

Additionally, I used styled components for trying that library, as well as testing with the TS Jest library.

A small, fun project to learn this impressive architectural design pattern.

Still to do:

- [x] Basic app with clean architecture
- [x] Basic styling
- [ ] Local storage instead of memory
- [ ] Drag + Drop
